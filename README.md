# Leaflet_Challenge
## Geo-mapping Homework Challenge for GA Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has collected scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and  environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Our  team was tasked with building a new set of tools that will allow USGS to visualize their data.

We provided with the URL of the desired JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.
