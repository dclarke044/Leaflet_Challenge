# Leaflet_Challenge
## Geo-mapping Homework Challenge for GA Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has collected scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and  environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Our  team was tasked with building a new set of tools that will allow USGS to visualize their data.

We were provided with the URL of the desired GeoJSON to pull in the data for our visualization, for further details on the data used please vist the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). Using Leaflet, we created a map that plots all of the earthquakes within the GeoJSON based on the cordinates provided for each earthquakes' epienter.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color.
